This is a project which uses computer vision/or a set of checkboxes to emulate punch cards for the PDP-8 (tm?).

I realize that punchcards weren't really used with this processor, but it's somewhat amusing.

This might be useful for a person wanting the ease of programming with punch cards without the ecological consequences of paper use.
