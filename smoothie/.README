This is a project which provides a visual simulation of the blending of a smoothie. It includes several algorithms, ranging from simple to overly complex. I think that smoothies are delicious, and this project will help me visually simulateone when I don't have the ingredients/blender to make one.

I feel like I should use gulp here, but I feel like I would be pun-ished for doing something that obvious.
